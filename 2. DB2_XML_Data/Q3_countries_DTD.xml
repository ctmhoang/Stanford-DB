<!--   In this question, you are to create a DTD for a small XML data set about world countries. This data is adapted from the Mondial 3.0 database as hosted by the University of Washington, and was originally compiled by the Georg-August University of Goettingen Institute for Informatics. Each country has a name, population, and area (in sq. km). Some countries also list languages (with percentages of the population that speaks each language) and/or cities (with names and populations).              -->
<!--   Write a DTD for the XML data set.  -->
<!--   Important: Do not include <!DOCTYPE countries [...]> in your DTD. Your DTD should start with <!ELEMENT countries (country*)>. >.                     -->
